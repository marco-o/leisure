Notes about doing the wok the pyton way

Prerequisites:

pip install pyautogui
pip install Display
pip install Xlib

pip install paho-mqtt

Some extra throughts:
Probably this way is much easier to go, especially once we use an HTTP interface. 
So tasks(s) are:
1. Set up discovery  (avahi)
2. Use the web interface to drive the browser.
   Nice to have: a unified function for that tasks + MQTT & HTTP backend
3. An app that issues HTTP (MQTT?) commnds to the 'hidden' server. Nice to have: some
   kind of encryption/token to keep malicious out
